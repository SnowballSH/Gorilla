# Gorilla Programming Language

## Gorilla is a programming language that is built to help me understand the basics of Lexers, Parsers, Interpreters, Virtual Machines, and Compilers, and Efficient Go.

#### Notice that this is not a production-ready language ~~, and it will never be~~.

### The language will have basic functionalities and will be able to program most algorithms.

### This language is an extension to [the Monkey Programming Language](https://monkeylang.org/), but it contains a lot of new features as well as more simple and flexible syntax.

##### To learn these things, I am following two books by Thorsten Ball:

- [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
- [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/)

P.S. the two books cost you about 50 USD total, but I think it is worth it to buy it at a lower price on
Amazon or other websites (or get it for free in some online archives, but it is always good to purchase it -- to pay the author respect).
