## Welcome to the Gorilla Programming Language!

### What is Gorilla?

Gorilla is a tiny, dynamically typed, flexible programming language, written in [Golang](https://golang.org/)

Gorilla is built to make simple, flexible, well-understood programs in a relatively fast way.

### Why should I use Gorilla?

- It is **gorilla-crawling-blaze-ish fast** compared to other dynamic, interpreted languages
    - According to a fibonacci benchmark, Gorilla is **36% faster** than [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Gorilla is compiled into [Gorilla Bytecode](https://github.com/SnowballSH/Gorilla/blob/master/code/code.go#L6-L100)
- It is **dynamic and flexible**
    - You **don't have to worry** about all those `semicolons or modules anymore!
    - Gorilla has **Python/Ruby style** assignment expression: `name = value`, which looks clean
    - Gorilla also has **concise operators** like `array <- item`, which obviously puts `item` to the end of `array`
- While it is dynamic, you can write type-safe code
    - 99% of Gorilla's builtin functions are **type-safe**
    - Gorilla has **builtin support** for type annotations and assertions for functions
