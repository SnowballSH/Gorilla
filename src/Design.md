## Language Design for Gorilla

### Gorilla is a programming language that is built to help me understand the basics of Lexers, Parsers, Interpreters, Virtual Machines, and Compilers, and Efficient Go.
### Notice that this is not a production-ready language, and it will never be.

### The language will have basic functionalities and will be able to program most algorithms, but will not have the same level of garbage collecting, speed, and powerfulness comparing to Go, Java, Python, and others.

#### Basic Syntax

```
<statement> [\r or \r\n or \n] <statement> ...
<statement> ; <statement> ...
```
