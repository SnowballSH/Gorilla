# Gorilla Programming Language

---

### NEWS

I'm sorry to announce this, but development of Gorilla 1.0 has been stopped.

I've had tons of fun building this language. I learned testing, parsing, bytecodes, encoding, and many more.

However, I think it is the time to leave this language. This project has been there for quite some months, but there is
nothing special about it. It doesn't have great syntax. It has terrible speed. It cannot even implement mutable values.

Therefore, this project is now archived. You can still play the Go version at
the [playground](https://snowballsh.me/Gorilla-Playground/), but version 1.0 will probably never come.

However, that does not mean I will stop making programming languages. A new idea has born, and it will come soon.

Thank you for those who stared or forked this repository, and those who supported me and followed along. You guys
provided amazing mental support.

See you in my next programming language -- it will be awesome, I promise.

Gorilla 0.x is written in pure Go.
