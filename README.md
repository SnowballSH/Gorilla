# Gorilla Programming Language

## NEWS:

This is the unstable/developing branch of Gorilla 1.0. It is current work-in-progress.

Gorilla 1.0 is focusing on speed and safety. I am aiming for
100% [test coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/SnowballSH/Gorilla)

**If you are expecting a fully-working gorilla source code, visit
the [0.x branch](https://github.com/SnowballSH/Gorilla/tree/0.x)**

If you are a golang developer, and you know some basic runtime or parsing knowledge, you are more than welcome to
contribute!

If you are not, feel free to create issues about what you are expecting.

Gorilla 1.0 will have a big syntax and runtime change. The runtime will be similar to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
, and syntax will be similar to [Coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/) (without indentations). Stay tuned!
